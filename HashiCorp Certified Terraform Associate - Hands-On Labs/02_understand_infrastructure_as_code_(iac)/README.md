### What is Infrastructure as Code

#### What is Infrastructure as Code

Infrastructure as Code is essentially a hub that can be used for collaboration
across the IT organization to improve infrastructure deployments, increase our
ability to scale quickly, and improve the application development process.
Infrastructure as Code allows us to do all this consistently and proficiently.
By using Infrastructure as Code for both our on-premises infrastructure and the
public cloud, our organization can provide dynamic infrastructure to both our
internal team members and ensure our customers have an excellent experience.

#### Benefits of IaC

While there are many benefits of Infrastructure as Code, a few key benefits
include simplifying cloud adoption, allowing us to adopt cloud-based services
and offerings to improve our capabilities quickly. Infrastructure as Code allows
us to remove many of the manual steps required today for infrastructure
requests, giving us the ability to automate approved requests without worrying
about tickets sitting in a queue. We can also use Infrastructure as Code to
provide capacity-on-demand by offering a library of services for our developers.
We can publish a self-service capability where developers and application owners
can beempowered to request and provision infrastructure that bettermatches their
requirements. Again, all of this is possible while driving standardization and
consistency throughout the organization, which can drive efficiencies and reduce
errors or deviations from established norms.

#### Example of IaC

#### IaC Tools

The list below represents some of the most popular Infrastructure as Code tools
used by many organizations worldwide. These tools focus on deploying
infrastructure on a private or public cloud platform. The list does NOT include
tools such as Puppet, Chef, Saltstack, or Ansible since those are commonly
placed in the configuration management category and donâ€™t really deploy
infrastructure resources. There are likely other tools available, but they are
not as popular as the ones listed below.
